# Slock app user validation program
Welcome to our program, it is a pleasure to see you here.

We work to enable new sharing experiences and provide you with a glimpse on how blockchain technology can power new ideas.

Because the app is still in the alpha stage, some things might still be puzzling or seem unpolished. We would love to get your feedback on the current stage! Feel free to contact us via slack, email or just create a issue here in our github.

## The Universal Sharing Network
In the rise of mobile and tablet controlled objects like smart houses and drones, it sounds sensible to create a platform in which people can profit from the shared access to those assets.

USN stands for Universal Sharing Network, a mechanism that represents IoT devices as physical assets, with a set of smart contracts. The Slock app brings this potential to the public, allowing users to rent anything that can be locked or controlled via mobile phones.

It is also public - anyone can add assets and extend its functionalities. Jump into the [Github repository](https://github.com/Trusted-IoT-Alliance/usn) for more detailed information.

## Slock Pi
Decentralization is one of most fundamental changes that internet technologies are facing at the moment. It minimizes the impact of cyber attacks and engages the users in making important decisions as a democratic principle.

The Slock Pi was engineered with these principles in mind. By mixing the comfort of home automation platforms, the low cost of the raspberry pi, the decentralization of blockchain and open source software we enable you to be part of the sharing economy.

Get some hands-on by following our [Slock Pi guide](https://github.com/slockit/usn-mvp/wiki).
